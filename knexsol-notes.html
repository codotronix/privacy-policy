		Knexsol Notes (hereby referred to as <strong>"this app"</strong>) <i>does not collect or store</i> any user data. Please find below a detailed summary of all the data this app uses / requires to operate.
	</p>

	<h3><u>Detailed Summary of Data Collection and Usage</u></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			This app does not store or colect any user identifiable or private or public data. The notes / texts user creates are stored locally in user's device only and only shared when and to whom user wants to share with using native sharing widgets.
		</li>
		<li>
			In future this app may provide users the ability to store the notes/texts they create to store on server but they will need to be authenticated and logged in first. Thus only users themselves will be able to see their notes and no other party can access whatever notes / texts they store in their personal logged in account.
